# Project Info
While many people play video games, it can be difficult for some of them to play as games are often not very accessible to people with disabilities. Access is a project that compiles research and data on video game accessibility problems and proposes possible solutions for them. We explore the current solutions as well as our proposed solutions with code samples for future game developers. Within our research, we cover four major categories of accessibility: auditory, visual, motor, and cognitive impairments.

## Open Source Transition for Access

By May 31, Access will be converted to an open source project that can be taken up by anyone to continue the research or use the research to create games or game modifications that are accessible.  
Any user collected data will be deleted, and the repository for the website will be made public. Current mod progress will also be made public.  
We will create mod creation documentation for Dark Souls III. This will include the resources necessary, and links to basic tutorials.  
If anyone wishes to continue the project, email here: [insert email] to request access to the repository and other research data.
